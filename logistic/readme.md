code for training predictive modelsin "A Measured Perspective"
==============================================================

This code is based on [predictive modeling code that has been kicking around](https://github.com/tedunderwood/horizon/tree/master/logistic) in my workflow for the last 2-3 articles.

But I'm finally getting around to refactoring it and documenting it properly.

Documenting is still in process, but at least I've had a chance to rewrite the core modules (versatiletrainer and metaselector) so that they make better use of pandas, and are free of needless cruft. It's conceivable that someone could now read and understand the code, after I document it better!

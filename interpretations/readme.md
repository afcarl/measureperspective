interpretations
================

Mostly Jupyter notebooks that engage in initial exploratory visualization of patterns produced by **../logistic/main_experiment()**.

In particular:

**interpretFSFcomparison.ipynb** is posing questions that will eventually lead to figure 4. It uses a file (../results/reliable_comparisons.tsv) that was produced by the function *reliable_genre_comparisons()* in ../logistic/main_experiment.py.

**interpretgenrecomparisons.ipynb** poses questions about loss of accuracy between Scarborough, Bailey, etc; it supports assertions made in passing in section 3 of the article.

**interpretpaceofchange.ipynb** poses questions about the pace of change in science fiction. It supports assertions made in passing in the "Measuring Parallax" section of the article. (Note that these assertions also depend on other analysis, including analysis forthcoming in chapter 2 of *Distant Horizons.*) This notebook uses a file, ..results/change_comparisons.tsv, which was produced by the function *reliable_change_comparisons()* in ../logistic/main_experiment.py.

**genrespace.ipynb** is a dubious experiment not used in the article.

**groupedFSFcomparisons.csv** is data used in figure 4.

The name of this folder is not meant as an assertion about the hermeneutic character of the actions herein performed. It's just a name, y'all.
